# SPL Governance IDL SDK

The **Governance SDK** is a TypeScript-based library enabling developers to create, manage, and interact with the SPL Governance program on the Solana blockchain. It simplifies building governance applications by abstracting low-level blockchain operations into intuitive APIs.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Install the package**
```bash
npm i governance-idl-sdk
```

### 2. Working with the SDK:

i. Create an spl-governance instance:
```
import { SplGovernance } from "governance-idl-sdk";
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("RPC_ENDPOINT");
const splGovernance = new SplGovernance(
   connection,
   optionalProgramId // if custom governance program is used
);
```

ii. Fetch spl-governance data:
```
// Fetch all Realms accounts (v2)
const realms = await splGovernance.getAllRealms()

// Fetch proposal from its public key
const proposalAddress = new PublicKey("4HxrP3R6A6GcUv62VHG331gwJKNhrqHKF438oRztzz2r")
const proposal = await splGovernance.getProposalByPubkey(proposalAddress)
```

iii. Create spl-governance instructions:
```
// Create a new Realm instruction
 const createRealmIx = await splGovernance.createRealmInstruction(
    realmName,
    communityToken, // mint of the community token
    1, // minimum community tokens required to create the governance
    signer.publicKey, // realm authority
    undefined, // optional weight source
    councilToken, // mint of the council token
    "liquid", // community token type
    "membership" // council token type
)

// Deposit governing tokens instruction
const depositForSignerTwoIx = await splGovernance.depositGoverningTokensInstruction(
    realmAddress,
    communityToken,
    depositorAta,
    depositor,
    depositor,
    depositor,
    1
)
```
iv. Working with spl-governance PDAs
```
// Derive Realm Address
const realmAddress = splGovernance.pda.realmAccount({name: multisigName}).publicKey

// Derive Governance address
const governanceAddress = splGovernance.pda.governanceAccount({realmAccount: realmAddress, seed: governanceSeed}).publicKey
```

The `dist/` directory contains the compiled and bundled output of the SDK. It provides various formats (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.d.ts`) to support different environments, including:
- CommonJS (`index.js`)
- ES Modules (`index.mjs`)
- TypeScript projects (`index.d.ts` and `index.d.mts`)

### **Files in `dist/`**

1. **`index.d.mts`**

- Governance instructions are properly implemented.
- RPC calls function as expected and return valid responses.
  
### **Files in `tests/`**

1. **`instructions.ts`**  
   - **Description**: Contains test cases for the instruction-related functionality of the SDK. Likely verifies that instructions (e.g., `createProposal`, `castVote`) are constructed correctly and behave as expected.
